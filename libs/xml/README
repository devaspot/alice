Alice/SEAM binding for libxml2
------------------------------

Compilation:
After a successful bootstrap ;-) just type "make" in this
(<alice>/lib/xml) directory.

Installation:
Change the Makefile according to your needs. If you installed SEAM by
typing "./install-seam.sh" in the alice root directory, the first
line should be appropriate. If you did the bootstrapping manually, you
might want to choose the second line for INSTALLDIR.
