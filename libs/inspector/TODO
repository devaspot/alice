o I have not written type-mappers for all builtin types. Some are missing.
  See the last lines of TypeMappers.aml

o Strings cannot be expanded yet.

o The field 'limit' in containers is not used. Remove it.

o For the gnome-canvas, do not catch all events, but be more selective :
  use the 'button-press-event' mask for example.

o I defined the styles randomly. Some colors may look weird.

o It would be nice if arrays were updated dynamically. Same for threads.

o (Very) Minor efficiency pb : reselect() could be done only for entries
  that are known to be updated.

o Minor efficiency pb : the layout algorithm for the Board (and only for it !)
  is quadratic. It could be made linear quite easily. 

o Minor leak : when a future is removed from the inspector,
  its monitoring thread is still running (until the future is determined).
  One should kill that thread.

o When the Inspector window is not shown, GTK should not be loaded.
  It should also be possible to register an abstract type without loading GTK
  (which is not so obvious since registering a type may imply registering
   a new color)
