import signature CHANNEL from "CHANNEL-sig"

    (* We do not use channel-level locks in this implementation
     * because we wish to be able to read and write at the same time,
     * that is, reading an empty channel blocks until an element is put,
     * or until the channel is closed. *)

    (* The underlying representation of a channel is a list. *
     * The state of a channel consists in
     *   - a pointer to the first element of the list
     *   - a promise to the not-yet-here last element of the list
     *   - the number of elements of the list
     *   - A promise which is fulfilled when the channel is closed.
     *)

    (* Invariants :
     *   While reading is locked, at least 'count' elements are available.
     *   If the channel is closed, the list ends by nil
     *        and contains 'count' elements (while reading is locked)
     *  See the end of the file for other invariants.
