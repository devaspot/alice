WHAT DO WE NEED TYPES FOR DURING COMPILATION?


- Translation of constructors

- Translation of module language:
  * signature coercions

- Translation of type classes:
  * dictionary passing
  * signature coercions

- Representation analysis:
  * overloaded literals
  * statically detect constructor arity mismatches
  * optimize tags
  * optimize partial record patterns
  * boxing/unboxing ?
